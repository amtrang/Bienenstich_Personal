It was on a bleak rainy day, sitting in the Berlin Airport, that I saw something I wouldn't soon forget.
I saw a squirrel racing across the tarmac with an entire Apfelkuchen in its mouth.
That pastry was from my auntie's baeckerei that only sells apple-based desserts.
My dog just ate my lederhose.
I can't believe he just did that; I just bought these at the Schloss Eltz!
I guess I should go chill out under this Klimaanlage vent.
But what do I wear? I can see if mom left any extra dirndels.
While I'm at it, I'll make myself at mehlhase.
And since I've calmed down I can go to work at the Brot Store.
...and now I've lost my train of thought; 
Don't judge me too harshly, dear reader, 
it is clear that my mind was carried off in that squirrel's mouth along with the Apfelkuchen--
and now image melds into unrelated image like disparate animals baked into a Bratwurst: 
more evidence of the disordered firings of my busted syntax!
It was a very intense and wettbewerbsf√§hig moment.
Then I drive my Porsche and quickly run away.
The moment was so intense that not even a Porche' engine could match the intensity!
While going to the Biergarten, he realized he forgot his hund!
If the intensity was a building, it'd be as a large as a Schloss.
The sound of a BMW engine, however, is comparable.
I think I will take some time off from this intense moment, and go chill in my favorite place in the world, my Biergarten.
